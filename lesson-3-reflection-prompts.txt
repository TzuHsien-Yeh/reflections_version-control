When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  When working with other people or using different device to work on the same project. 
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because I might be working on a branch, having a lot of commits yet not ready to push the temporary result to GitHub. Half-way work might confuse collaborators of the project.  


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
    Fork: a copy of someone's repository on GitHub onto your own GitHub. When you want to make change to/have your own version while not autherized to make change on someone's repository. Forking would mark the original author.

    Clone: a copy of a repository on GitHub/Local device to a local device/another spot in local device. When you want to work on your repositories (including forks) on your device. 

    Branch: an independent line of development. When experimenting new features or different versions.
