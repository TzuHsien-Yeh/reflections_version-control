When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  When working with other people or using different device to work on the same project. 
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because I might be working on a branch, having a lot of commits yet not ready to push the temporary result to GitHub. Half-way work might confuse collaborators of the project.  


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
    Fork: a copy of someone's repository on GitHub onto your own GitHub. When you want to make change to/have your own version while not autherized to make change on someone's repository. Forking would mark the original author.

    Clone: a copy of a repository on GitHub/Local device to a local device/another spot in local device. When you want to work on your repositories (including forks) on your device. 

    Branch: an independent line of development. When experimenting new features or different versions.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
    You can update the change from GitHub (by other collaborators/devices) to the remote stored locally (origin/master) on your device. In case a new commit hasn't been pushed with a new commit on GitHub repository different from it. You can fetch the new commit from GitHub repository to (origin/master) and compare/merge with the local (master). 
    Fix the conflict in the file. Commit and push the merged commit to update the GitHub repository.

    (git fetch) + (git merge origin/master master) here = (git pull)



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
    Without using Git/GitHub, I would send the file I've made changes on it to my collaborators and wait for their reviews. Once they approve to accept the changes, I would update the file to be our latest version. 
    It would be harder for us to check the certain part of the file that has been changed. 


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
