What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	(git init) It creates a new git repository. 
	(ls -a)  A git directory will be created in the directory of the files. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area provides a space to compile what the commit you want to submit at a time.
	Working directory is the place stores the actual repository.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	Store only files with certain logical change to be committed in a repository to the staging area. 
	(git commit) those files with the logical change at a time. 
	(git add) the other logical change to the staging area and commit it again. 
	(git reset) to remove the file from staging area. 


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	When try to develop new features while having the current latest version available to be used/reviewed. 
	Once the new features could work properly, this branch can be merged with the master branch that has gone on for a few commits.
	Usually: master branch to be open to the public, other branches to experiment or adding new features that are not yet quality-checked.

	Another usage of branch is to develop different version or special version. (e.g., easy mode, area-customed)

the diagram the way we do?
